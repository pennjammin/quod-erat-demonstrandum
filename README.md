A few code samples.

Just a note, I have left out some components as well as any __KEYS__. I simply wanted to demonstrate how I would lay out a page, the components within as well as handling the data via AJAX/REST. I specifically picked files that I had done myself (they have been reviewed a bit and are still in progress, however, this is my my work). I plan on trying to open source a more generic React component for decent 'flippers' as all the ones I have run in to are subpar and herein is the beginning of said component. This sample is derived from a custom page of white-label SEO tools that leverage Google Insights API, made with Next.js (hence the getInitialProps) and also integrates with Mailchimp for e-mail submissions. Thanks so much for taking the time to check it out and although most of my repos (even personal stuff) are on Bitbucket I would be happy to find some other stuff. Looking forward to the code challenge as well. Cheers!
